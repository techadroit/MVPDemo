# MVPDemo
A simple app to demonstrates MVP with mvvm architecture in android.

In this app we have used viewmodel to retain the presenter across the recreation of activity. 

Data fetching from the api is done using retrofit with rxjava. Live data has been used to pass values from presenter to view.
